                    <h2>Aurangabad</h2>
                    <p>Aurangabad is a city in Maharashtra state, in India. It’s known for the 17th-century marble Bibi ka Maqbara shrine, styled on the Taj Mahal. The nearby Shivaji Maharaj Museum, dedicated to the Maratha king Shivaji, displays war weapons and a coin collection. North of the city, the Aurangabad Caves comprise ancient, rock-cut Buddhist shrines. West of the city, battlements surround the medieval Daulatabad Fort.
                    Khaḍkī was the original name of the village which was made a capital city by Malik Ambar, the Prime Minister of Murtaza Nizam Shah II, Sultan of Ahmednagar. Within a decade, Khaḍkī grew into a populous and imposing city. Malik Ambar died in 1626.[14] He was succeeded by his son Fateh Khan, who changed the name of Khaḍkī to Fatehnagar. With the capture of Devagiri Fort by the imperial troops in 1633, the Nizam Shahi dominions, including Fatehnagar, came under the possession of the Mughals.[15]In 1653, when Mughal prince Aurangzeb was appointed the Viceroy of the Deccan for the second time, he made Fatehnagar his capital and renamed it Aurangabad. Aurangabad is sometimes referred to as Khujista Bunyad by the chroniclers of Aurangzeb's reign.[16]

                    In 1667 Muazzam, son of Aurangzeb became governor of this province. Before him
                    Mirza Rajah Jai Singh was in-charge of this province for some time.[17]

                    In 1681, after Aurangzeb's coronation as emperor, he shifted his court from
                    the capital city of Delhi to Aurangabad in order to conduct his military
                    campaigns in the Deccan. The presence of Mughal elites in the city led to
                    urban development, as numerous public and private buildings were constructed.
                    Though Aurangzeb chose not to reside in the city after 1684, the city
                    retained importance as the primary military outpost of the Mughal Deccan,
                    attracting wealth and turning Aurangabad into a centre of trade; the
                    manufacture of embroidered silks emerged during this period and is still
                    practiced in Aurangabad today. Mughal Aurangabad was also a cultural hub,
                    serving as an important centre of Persian and Urdu literature. During the
                    Mughal era, Aurangabad </p>

                    <h2>Udaipur</h2>
                    <p>The Ahar River bank was inhabited in about 2000 BCE. There are footprints of two different civilizations, which provides claims about earliest inhabitants of the Ahar culture: the first ones are the Bhil/Bheels, the indigenous tribes originated at this place, and are still residing in the area in large numbers. The second footprints were of Rajputs, who once entered the enclosed valley, and then continued to live in this place for centuries.Statue of Maharana Pratap of Mewar, commemorating the Battle of Haldighati.
                    Udaipur was founded in 1559,[5] by Maharana Udai Singh II in the fertile circular Girwa Valley to the southwest of Nagda, on the Banas River. The city was established as the new capital of the Mewar kingdom. This area already had a thriving trading town, Ayad, which had served as the capital of Mewar in the 10th through 12th centuries.[5] The Girwa region was thus already well known to Chittaud rulers who moved to it whenever the vulnerable tableland Chittaurgarh was threatened with enemy attacks. Rana Udai Singh II, in the wake of 16th-century emergence of artillery warfare, decided during his exile at Kumbhalgarh to move his capital to a more secure location. Ayad was flood-prone, hence he chose the ridge east of Pichola Lake to start his new capital city, where he came upon a hermit while hunting in the foothills of the Aravalli Range. In the myth, the hermit blessed the king and guided him to build a palace on the spot, assuring him it would be well protected. Udai Singh II consequently established a residence on the site. In November 1567, the Mughal Emperor Akbar conquered Chittor. To protect his territory from attack, Rana Udai Singh built a six-kilometre-long city wall, with seven gates,[15] namely Surajpole, Chandpole, Udiapole, Hathipole, Ambapole, Brahmpole, Delhi Gate, and Kishanpole. The area within these walls and gates is still known as the old city or the walled city.</p>

                    <h2>Coimbatore</h2>
                    <p>The region around Coimbatore was ruled by the Cheras during Sangam period between c. 1st and the 4th centuries CE and it served as the eastern entrance to the Palakkad Gap, the principal trade route between the west coast and Tamil Nadu.[20] The Kosar tribe mentioned in the 2nd century CE Tamil epic Silappathikaram and other poems in Sangam literature is associated with the Coimbatore region.[21] The region was located along an ancient Roman trade route that extended from Muziris to Arikamedu.[22][23] The medieval Cholas conquered the Kongu Nadu in the 10th century. A Chola highway called Rajakesari Peruvazhi ran through the region.[24][25] Much of Tamil Nadu came under the rule of the Vijayanagara Empire by the 15th century. In the 1550s, Madurai Nayaks, who were the military governors of the Vijaynagara Empire, took control of the region. After the Vijayanagara Empire fell in the 17th century, the Madurai Nayaks established their state as an independent kingdom. They introduced the Palayakkarar system under which Kongu Nadu region was divided into 24 Palayams(towns</p>
